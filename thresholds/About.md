This directory contains the source code and corresponding plots for determining the type of piece, that is, white or black on chess board. I thought about assigning a threshold based on the color difference to make the task of finding a piece simpler. However, I decided to go ahead without this part of the code as it increased the duration to recognize the position of pieces on the board.
